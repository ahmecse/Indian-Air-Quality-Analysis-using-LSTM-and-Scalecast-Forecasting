# Indian Air Quality Analysis using LSTM and Scalecast Forecasting

This project focuses on analyzing Indian air quality using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and Scalecast forecasting techniques. By leveraging these methods, we aim to gain insights into air pollution trends and develop accurate predictions for future air quality conditions in India.

## Project Goals

- Analyze and understand the patterns and trends in Indian air quality data.
- Implement LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models to capture the temporal dependencies in the air quality data.
- Utilize Scalecast forecasting to predict future air quality conditions in different regions of India.
- Provide valuable insights into air pollution levels and assist in decision-making processes related to environmental management and public health.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset of Indian air quality measurements, including various pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3. The dataset covers multiple cities and regions across India, spanning a significant time period.

## Technologies Used

- Python programming language for data preprocessing, model development, and analysis.
- TensorFlow and Keras libraries for implementing LSTM models.
- Scalecast forecasting techniques for predicting air quality conditions.
- Data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn for generating insightful plots and charts.
